Subject: [PATCH] chore: allow CMake though to 3.10

This is allows the build with cmake-4.0.0 without deprecation warnings.

use min...max syntax to allow build with newer cmake.
ref: https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/cmake_minimum_required.html

Fixes:
CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:1 (cmake_minimum_required):
  Compatibility with CMake < 3.5 has been removed from CMake.

  Update the VERSION argument <min> value.  Or, use the <min>...<max> syntax
  to tell CMake that the project requires at least <min> but has been updated
  to work with policies introduced by <max> or earlier.

  Or, add -DCMAKE_POLICY_VERSION_MINIMUM=3.5 to try configuring anyway.
