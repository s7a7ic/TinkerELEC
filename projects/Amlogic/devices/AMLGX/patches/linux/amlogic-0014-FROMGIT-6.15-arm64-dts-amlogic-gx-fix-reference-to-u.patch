Subject: [PATCH 14/55] FROMGIT(6.15): arm64: dts: amlogic: gx: fix reference
 to unknown/untested PWM clock

Device-tree expects absent clocks to be specified as <0> (instead of
using <>). This fixes using the FCLK4/FCLK3 clocks as they are now
seen at their correct index (while before they were recognized, but at
the correct index - resulting in the hardware using a different clock
than what the kernel sees).

Fixes: a526eeef9a81 ("arm64: dts: amlogic: gx: switch to the new PWM controller binding")
