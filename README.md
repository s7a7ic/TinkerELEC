# TinkerELEC

This is a fork of the popular [LibreELEC.tv](https://github.com/LibreELEC/LibreELEC.tv) distribution, modified by me to run better on the ASUS Tinker Board S.

It's based on the master branch commit 6848c7a (6848c7aea52b385f884746152f33499c7319b911) from May 15, 2025.

Some packages were downgraded and patches were added to be able to run Kodi 21.2 (see commit history).
