# TinkerELEC

This is a fork of the popular [LibreELEC.tv](https://github.com/LibreELEC/LibreELEC.tv) distribution, modified by me to run better on the **ASUS Tinker Board S**.

It's based on the libreelec-12.0 branch commit 6a7c6a427773cd9f7f5a93b6f525779c220ad350 from Jun 15, 2025.

More information, some useful scripts and configurations to use after the installation can be found in the [Project Repository](https://github.com/s7a7ic/TinkerELEC-Project).

## Reason

I have the **ASUS Tinker Board S** which has an integrated Wireless LAN and Bluetooth Chip (RTL8723BS), but the driver support isn't so good as expected and the RK3288 SoC has some regressions with current Linux Kernels. So I'm trying to get a better working device with some minor changes (patches, different drivers).

Also I'm using the NesPi Case+ and wanted to have the "safe shutdown" functionality of the front panel buttons. I have planed to add an infrared receiver and temperature aware fan control integrated inside the case.
